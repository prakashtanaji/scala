# Getting started
Scala is yet another language like Java which compiles to Java bytecode, i.e., libraries built usng Scala can be used in java program and vice versa.

Then why use Scala? It provides more flexibilty than java to create programs using different ways.

## Install Scala
Scala uses JVM to execute the programs written in it. We still do need scala compiler to convert code to byte code.

Install scala using one of the suggested ways at 
https://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.12.11.html


## Unlike java, scala provides several ways to write and run the applications

1. We can write program in interactive mode directly on the shell
2. Write code into the file with '.scala' extension and use 'scalac' to compile and produce bytecode with '.class' extension and 'scala' to execute the class file.
3. Run scala as the shell script

Although the way you a choose to create your program depends on the usecase, but what really binds them all together is the syntax which stays the same all across.

## Misc
When in scala shell, provide options with ':' prefix to try out various options, like :help to get help in shell.
